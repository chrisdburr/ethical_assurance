From Guidelines for AI Procurement (OAI, 2020):

"Some specialist roles to consider for your AI project team:

• Data Architect
• Data Scientist
• Data Engineer
• Technical Architect
• Delivery Manager
• Security Architect
• Commercial Manager
You may not need all of these roles from the very beginning, but consider your needs before you start. It is useful to consult experts to ensure that you have the right foundations in place to go to market, and have verified that you can integrate an AI system with your existing processes, technologies, and services."

Could a new role for assurance be created with standardised requirements and job description? Similar to data ethicist role.
